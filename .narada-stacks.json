In a production environment, this would contain the actual text content extracted from the PDF file using libraries like pdf-parse or pdf2pic with OCR.\n\nThe extracted content would typically include:\n- Document headers and titles\n- Body text with proper paragraph structure\n- Tables and lists (formatted as text)\n- Metadata like author, creation date, etc.\n\nTo implement real PDF extraction, you would:\n1. Install pdf-parse: npm install pdf-parse\n2. Use it in a Node.js environment to extract text\n3. Handle images within PDFs using OCR if needed\n4. Preserve document structure and formatting\n\nExample implementation:\n```javascript\nimport pdf from 'pdf-parse';\nconst buffer = await file.arrayBuffer();\nconst data = await pdf(Buffer.from(buffer));\nreturn data.text;\n```\n\nThis simulated content represents what would be extracted from a typical PDF document.",
